# Crop Yield Prediction Using Random Forest Algorithm

![Crop Yield Prediction](crop_yield_image.jpg)

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting crop yields using the Random Forest algorithm. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, we aim to provide accurate predictions of crop yields based on various input features such as weather data, soil quality, and crop type.

## Features

- **Random Forest Algorithm**: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for predictive modeling.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and feature engineering.
- **Model Evaluation**: Employs evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the predictive model.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations to better understand the data and model predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/crop-yield-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is formatted appropriately with features and target variables.
2. Data Preprocessing: Run data preprocessing scripts to clean and preprocess the data.
3. Train the Model: Train the Random Forest model using the preprocessed data.
4. Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics.
5. Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
